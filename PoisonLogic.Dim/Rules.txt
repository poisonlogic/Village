One manager per instance
Communicate though interfaces

ALL WRONG!!!!!!!!!
---------Each plug in level is a level of granularity
---------Creature - Humanoid
---------Race - Elf
---------Pop - Jim

It's not a tree. It's atributes.
Jim is a pop
His Race is Elf
His Creature type is Humanoid

If you want to use something from another mod. Say you want to add a stat buff...
you have to find your targets instanceid and ask for them as a IStatUser.
from there you can get a handler and do what ever you want

2 diverging forms.....
Stat is a catalog putting all the work on the handler The handler is the instance
Jobs is a manager keeping track of the instancest as they run


Difference between link and patch (need better names)
Patch: is when you are working with someone elses class. Like trying to tell the admin that all buildings and pops are now water users.
Link: is when you are providing an interface to future poeple. Like saying "Here, this is what you need to do to be a water user".
